  <h1>Guardian Tales</h1>
  <hr>
  
  <h3>What Is Guardian Tales</h3>
  <p> Guardian tales satrts off as you playing as a knight of Kanteburry, until the Invaders, well... Invade. You are then blown away into kanteburry forest and are in search of Little princess to protect and you will continue your journey to beat the invaders.</p>
  
  <br>
  <h3>Equipments</h3>
  <p>There are many equipments in this game and going over them all, would take forever to read, so the thing you need to know is the types of weapons, that are Two handed swords, one handed sword, shield, bow, rifle, staff, gauntlet, basket, and claw.</p>

  <h4>Cards</h4>
  <p>Cards are another thing you can equip, which vary from each other. Some cards increase attack, others defesne.</p>
  
  <h3>Characters</h3>
  <p>The main character of this game is the knight, which is you. Though you dont need to choose him/her to be in the scenes and can choose another character.</p>
  
  <p>The way to obtain the characters are through gacha system, which takes 300 gems for one summoning of a character or 2,700 gems for 10 summons. You can also summon for weapons. the characters come in two tiers, unique and rare heroes, where unique heros are way better than the rare heros, though they are harder to get.</p>
<br>

<h3>Is it worth to play</h3>
<p>Yes It is worth it to play and I recomend it, but only If you have patience, since It takes a while to progress through the game, since It is very difficult, but the story and quests make up for it.</p>
